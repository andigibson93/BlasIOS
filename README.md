# BlasIOS

1. Built backend API express that serves up different endpoints to my own app with Node JS. This delivers the images.
2. Used a custom collection view to display images.
3. Made different threads to call the api.
4. Used image caching to deliver the images from the API. Once the images are loaded, they are cached so we don't have to keep redownloading the images.
